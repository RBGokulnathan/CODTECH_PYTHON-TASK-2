 ## OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT
 ### PROJECT NAME: Simple calculator using python

 ## OBJECTIVE
 The objectives of creating a calculator program using Python include:

*1.Functionality:* The calculator program should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and choose an operator to calculate the result.
*2.User Interaction:* The program should provide a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and select the operation they want to perform.
*3.Error Handling:* The calculator should handle potential errors, such as division by zero, and provide appropriate error messages.
*4.Customization:* The program can be extended to include additional features, such as square root, exponentiation, or handling more complex expressions.
*5.Educational Purpose:* Creating a calculator program serves as a practical exercise for learning Python programming concepts, including functions, conditional statements, and user input.
